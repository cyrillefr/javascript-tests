# JavaScript Tests

A suite of JavaScript tests (hopefully) useful for interviews.

A note from me, Cyrille.
This is my modified and added JS files. Protocol to test my files is the same as below(but it will install dependancies).

New files are:
  - impl-clone-object
  - impl-flatten-array.js

Modified files are: 
  - clone-object.js
  - flatten-array.js
  - scoping.js
Modified lines within the codes are commented

## How to use
1. `npm install`
2. `npm test`
3. Get the candidate to complete the tests and Karma should watch the files and run the tests on save.
